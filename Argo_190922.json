The Argo Bookshop, in conjunction with the JET Alumni Association of Quebec and Atlantic Canada, will be hosting its summer Japan Book Club on August 27.\nFor this meeting, we'll be discussing The Fox and Dr. Shimamura by Christine Wunnicke. A work of historical fiction by a German author, we look at the life of a Meiji-era Japanese doctor trying to train the eye of modern psychological eye on the phenomenon of people being possessed by fox spirits. For being 150 pages, this book packs in a lot to discuss - science, folklore, gender, surreealism, history, Westernization in Japan, and much more.\nJoin us online via Zoom for a lively discussion of a thoughtful and offbeat piece of literature about Japan! You can read the book in any language. You're also welcome to come if you haven't read the book, but there will likely be spoilers."

The event will be moderated by Helen Chau Bradley. The event is free and will be taking place via Zoom at 7 PM on Thursday, September 17th - email events @ argobookshop . ca for the Zoom link!\n-\nA little before seven in the morning, Stacey wakes to the police pounding on her door. They search her home and seize her computer and her phone, telling her they\u2019re looking for \u201cillegal digital material.\u201d Left to unravel what\u2019s happened, Stacey must find a way to take back the privacy and freedom she feels she has lost. Luckily, she has her friends. Smart and tough and almost terrifyingly open, Stacey and her circle are uncommonly free of biases and boundaries, but this incident reveals how they are still susceptible to society\u2019s traps. Navigating her way through friendship, love, and sex, Stacey strives to restore her self-confidence and to actualize the most authentic way to live her life \u2014 one that acknowledges both her power and her vulnerability, her joy and her fear.\nAll I Ask is a bold and bracing exploration of what it\u2019s like to be young in a time when everything and nothing seems possible. With a playwright\u2019s ear for dialogue and a wry, delicate confidence, Eva Crocker writes with a compassionate but unsentimental eye on human nature that perfectly captures the pitfalls of relying on the people you love.\nAbout the author:\nEva Crocker is the author of the critically acclaimed debut short story collection Barrelling Forward, which won the Alistair MacLeod Prize for Short Fiction and the CAA Emerging Writer Award, was a finalist for the Writers\u2019 Trust Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBTQ Emerging Writers and the NLCU Fresh Fish Award for Emerging Writers, and was a National Post Best Book.\nAbout the moderator:\nHelen Chau Bradley is a writer, musician, and arts administrator living in Tio\u2019tia:ke / Montreal. Their work has appeared in carte blanche, Cosmonauts Avenue, Entropy Magazine, Maisonneuve Magazine, Ricepaper Magazine, and elsewhere. Personal Attention Roleplay, a collection of short stories, is forthcoming from Metonymy Press in Fall 2021. Automatic Object Lessons, a poetry chapbook, is forthcoming from House House Press in late 2020. "

Her story of the Shining Prince of the Imperial Court and his life, culture, and relationships with women, has stood the test of time and forms an important piece of the foundation of Japanese literature.\nFor 2020, the Japan Book Club, presented in collaboration between the Argo and JETAA Q/A, is meeting monthly to discuss this important and still lively work. You can read the complete Tale of Genji in any of its English translations, by Arthur Waley, Edward Seidensticker, Royall Tyler, or Dennis Washburn; we have all of them available to order in the store. You can also choose to read it in French or other languages, if you prefer.\nIn our fifth edition, we will be discussing Chapters 17-22 of the Tale of Genji in whatever translation you are reading. If you are interested in joining us, please email us at events@argobookshop.ca for the link. Please join us for this trip through a historic yet timeless tale!"

Participation is free and open to everyone!\n**Please email events @ argobookshop . ca to register and we'll send you the Zoom link.**\nLindsay Nixon's n\u00eetis\u00e2nak honours blood and chosen kin with equal care. A groundbreaking memoir spanning nations, prairie punk scenes, and queer love stories, it is woven around grief over the loss of their mother. It also explores despair and healing through community and family, and being torn apart by the same. Using cyclical narrative techniques and drawing on their Cree, Saulteaux, and M\u00e9tis ancestral teachings, this work offers a compelling perspective on the connections that must be broken and the ones that heal. It won the prestigious 2019 Dayne Ogilive Prize and a 2019 Quebec Writer\u2019s Federation first book prize, and has been nominated for a Lambda Literary Award and an Indigenous Voices Literary Award.\nLindsay Nixon is a Toronto-based Cree-M\u00e9tis-Saulteaux SSHRC doctoral scholarship recipient and a McGill University Art History Ph.D. candidate studying Trans.NDN digital creators and things. They are the co-founder of gijiit: a curatorial collective that focuses on community-engaged Indigenous art curations, gatherings, and research dealing with themes of gender, sex, and sexuality. They are a REVEAL Indigenous Art Award recipient, and have been awarded national Magazine Awards in the Essay category for \u201cStories Not Told\u201d and in the Best-Editorial Package category for \u201c#MeToo and the Secrets Indigenous Women Keep.\u201d"

Villoso, whose \"The Ikessar Falcon\" marks the second installment of her series Chronicles of the Bitch Queen - which began with \"The Wolf of Oren-Yaro,\" which draws on Filipino culture and myths to create a detailed fantasy world and uses the first person narrative of a beleaguered queen to explore a tale of secrets, lies, betrayal, and treason - and Evan Winter, whose \"The Fires of Vengeance\" follows up his series debut \"The Rage of Dragons,\" a brutal and gripping hero's journey that brings to light the ravages of war and colonialism in an expansive African-inspired epic fantasy.\nThe authors will follow their readings with a discussion on the theme of \"Storytelling as a Form of Resistance,\" so be sure not to miss this outstanding event! Join us on Thursday October 1st at 7 PM - sign up by emailing events @ argobookshop . ca and we'll send you the Zoom link.\n-\nK.S. Villoso writes speculative fiction with a focus on deeply personal themes and character-driven narratives. Much of her work is inspired by her childhood in the slums of Taguig, Philippines. She is now living amidst the forest and mountains with her husband, children, and dogs in Anmore, BC.\nBorn in England to South American parents, Evan Winter was raised in Africa near the historical territory of his Xhosa ancestors. Evan has always loved fantasy novels, but when his son was born, he realized that there weren\u2019t many epic fantasy novels featuring characters who looked like him. So, before he ran out of time, he started writing them."

The Argo Bookshop, in conjunction with the JET Alumni Association of Quebec and Atlantic Canada, will be hosting its autumn Japan Book Club on November 19.\nFor this meeting, we'll be discussing Territory of Light by Yuko Tsushima. This novel, originally serialized in the late 1970s as 12 stories, depicts a young mother as she starts a new life away from her ex-husband and raising a young child. In navigating Tokyo and her new independence, she shows a woman trying to find her way, with a great depth of emotion in the face of the trials of city life.\nJoin us online via Zoom for a lively discussion of a modern classic of Japanese literature! Email us at events @ argobookshop.ca for the link. You can read the book in any language. You're also welcome to come if you haven't read the book, but there will likely be spoilers."

Be it work, school, or bookstore events, most things we encounter in our day-to-day lives have been designed with a narrow scope of who can fully access and engage with them. Universal Design seeks to remove these barriers and create things (buildings, events, curricula, etc) that are accessible to everyone.\nFor our next disability series event, we welcome Dr. Beverly Barkon, an expert educator in Universal Design and accessibility, to talk about design without barriers and what all of our experience with the pandemic can teach us about accessibility. Although the idea of Universal Design isn't new - similar notions have existed since at least the 1960s - broader awareness and implementation still have a long way to go. Come learn about Universal Design with us!\nThe event is Thursday, January 28, at 7 PM Eastern. This is a free, ticketed event. If you have any difficulties with Eventbrite, please email events @ argobookshop . ca.\nPlease note that this event (like all our events!) will be captioned. If you have any other accessibility concerns, email us at events @ argobookshop . ca and we'll do what we can.\nDr. Beverly Barkon has been a faculty member at New Jersey City University in special education and in Project Mentor \u2014 a support program for college students with disabilities. A retired professor of special education at Carlow University, Pittsburgh, PA, Dr. Barkon has served as an educational liaison in the pediatric neuro-oncology clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh. In addition, she has been an expert witness in administrative law courts. She has presented at national and international conferences on the learning experiences and transition needs of survivors of pediatric cancers. Dr. Barkon also volunteers as a mentor/angel for Imerman\u2019s Angels, a one-on-one support program for newly diagnosed cancer patients.\nDr. Barkon earned her Ph.D. in communication disorders, field of learning disabilities from Northwestern University and has a Masters in Studies in Law in the areas of education and disability law from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law."

Mx. Tidbeck will be in conversation with fantasy author and playwright Sara Bergmark Elfgren.\nThe event is free, open to all, and captioned. To RSVP, click here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.ca/.../karin-tidbeck-the-memory...\nIn a world just parallel to ours exists a mystical realm known only as the Gardens. It\u2019s a place where feasts never end, games of croquet have devastating consequences, and teenagers are punished for growing up. For a select group of masters, it\u2019s a decadent paradise where time stands still. But for those who serve them, it\u2019s a slow torture where their lives can be ended in a blink. In a bid to escape before their youth betrays them, Dora and Thistle\u2014best friends and confidants\u2014set out on a remarkable journey through time and space. Traveling between their world and ours, they hunt for the one person who can grant them freedom. Along the way, they encounter a mysterious traveler who trades in favors and never forgets debts, a crossroads at the center of the universe, our own world on the brink of war, and a traveling troupe of actors with the ability to unlock the fabric of reality.\nEndlessly inventive, The Memory Theater takes us to a wondrous place where destiny has yet to be written, life is a performance, and magic can erupt at any moment. It is Karin Tidbeck\u2019s most engrossing and irresistible tale yet.\nKarin Tidbeck lives and works in Malm\u00f6 as a freelance writer and translator, and writes speculative fiction in Swedish and English. They debuted in 2010 with the Swedish collection Vem \u00e4r Arvid Pekon? Their English debut, the 2012 collection Jagannath, received the Crawford Award and was shortlisted for the World Fantasy Award. The novel was shortlisted for the Locus Award in 2018. Their second novel, The Memory Theater, came out in February 2021. Tidbeck\u2019s short fiction is published at Tor.com, Uncanny Magazine, Lightspeed and more. They dedicate their free time to games, swordfighting and forteana. Find them online at karintidbeck.com and Instagram as @ktidbeck.\nSara B. Elfgren is interested in many genres, but her primary focus is speculative fiction. She is attracted to \u201dwhat if\u201d-scenarios where the laws of nature are thrown out of balance, especially when the supernatural clashes with our everyday lives. She likes to work on her own and with other writers as well as illustrators, comic book artists and directors. Sara\u2019s solo debut, In Dreams (Norra Latin), was nominated to the to the Nordic Council Children and Young People\u2019s Literary Prize 2018, and she collaborated with artist Karl Johnsson on the bestselling epic fantasy comic inspired by Norse mythology, Vei."

The event is free, open to everyone, and captioned.\nRSVP here: https://www.eventbrite.ca/.../trans-nonbinary-book-club...\nInquisitive and expansive, Like a Boy but Not a Boy explores author andrea bennett's experiences with gender expectations, being a non-binary parent, and the sometimes funny and sometimes difficult task of living in a body. The book's fourteen essays also delve incisively into the interconnected themes of mental illness, mortality, creative work, class, and bike mechanics (apparently you can learn a lot about yourself through trueing a wheel). With thoughtfulness and acute observation, andrea bennett reveals intimate truths about the human experience, whether one is outside the gender binary or not.\nandrea bennett is a National Magazine Award\u2013winning writer and editor and the author of two travel guides, one book of poetry, and, most recently, the essay collection Like a Boy but Not a Boy: Navigating Life, Mental Health, and Parenthood Outside the Gender Binary (Arsenal Pulp Press), a CBC Books' pick for the top Canadian nonfiction of the year, and one of Autostraddle's best queer books of 2020. andrea's non-fiction has been published by the Globe and Mail, the Walrus, Hazlitt, Xtra, Reader's Digest, Chatelaine, and many other outlets."

The event is free, open to all, and captioned. RSVP on Eventbrite here: https://www.eventbrite.ca/.../elly-bangs-in-conversation...\nEvoking the gritty cyberpunk of Mad Max and the fluid idealism of Sense8, Unity is a spectacular new re-envisioning of humanity. Breakout author Elly Bangs has created an expressive, philosophical, science-fiction thriller that expands upon consciousness itself.\nDanae is not only herself. She is concealing a connection to a grieving collective inside of her body. But while she labors as a tech servant in the dangerous underwater enclave of Bloom City, her fractured self cannot mend. In a desperate escape, Danae and her lover Naoto hire the enigmatic ex-mercenary Alexei to guide them out of the imploding city. But for Danae to reunify, the three new fugitives will have to flee across the otherworldly beauty of the postapocalyptic Southwest. Meanwhile, Danae's warlord enemy, the Duke, and a strange new foe, the Borrower, already seek them at any price.\nElly Bangs was raised in a New Age cult and once rode her bicycle alone from Washington State to the Panama Canal. She lives in Seattle, where she spends her days fixing machines and her nights writing short stories, novellas, and novels\u2014usually speculative fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, and uncategorized weirdness\u2014with a thematic emphasis on longing, heartbreak, and the grim fate of humankind. Her short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Escape Pod, and others, and she's a graduate of Clarion West (class of 2017). Learn more about her at elbangs.com, where you can find her Story Premise Bot as well as A Pocket Guide to Nuclear War Survival & Preparedness.\nKameron Hurley is an award-winning author and trained historian specializing in the future of war and resistance movements. Hurley is the author of The Light Brigade, The Stars are Legion and the essay collection The Geek Feminist Revolution, as well as the award-winning God\u2019s War Trilogy and The Worldbreaker Saga. Hurley has won the Hugo Award, Locus Award, Kitschy Award, and Sydney J. Bounds Award for Best Newcomer. Her short fiction has appeared in Popular Science Magazine, Lightspeed and numerous anthologies. Hurley has also written for The Atlantic, Writers Digest, Entertainment Weekly, The Village Voice, LA Weekly, Bitch Magazine, and Locus Magazine. Hurley currently lives in Ohio, where she's cultivating an urban homestead."

The event is free, captioned, and open to all - register on Eventbrite here! https://www.eventbrite.ca/.../annalee-newitz-in...\nIn Four Lost Cities, acclaimed science journalist Annalee Newitz takes readers on an entertaining and mind-bending adventure into the deep history of urban life. Investigating across the centuries and around the world, Newitz explores the rise and fall of four ancient cities, each the center of a sophisticated civilization: the Neolithic site of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck in Central Turkey, the Roman vacation town of Pompeii on Italy\u2019s southern coast, the medieval megacity of Angkor in Cambodia, and the indigenous metropolis Cahokia, which stood beside the Mississippi River where East St. Louis is today.\nNewitz travels to all four sites and investigates the cutting-edge research in archaeology, revealing the mix of environmental changes and political turmoil that doomed these ancient settlements. Tracing the early development of urban planning, Newitz also introduces us to the often anonymous workers\u2014slaves, women, immigrants, and manual laborers\u2014who built these cities and created monuments that lasted millennia.\nFour Lost Cities is a journey into the forgotten past, but, foreseeing a future in which the majority of people on Earth will be living in cities, it may also reveal something of our own fate.\nAnnalee Newitz writes science fiction and nonfiction. They are the author of the book Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age, and the novels The Future of Another Timeline, and Autonomous, which won the Lambda Literary Award. As a science journalist, they are a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, and have a monthly column in New Scientist. They have published in The Washington Post, Slate, Popular Science, Ars Technica, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic, among others. They are also the co-host of the Hugo Award-winning podcast Our Opinions Are Correct. Previously, they were the founder of io9, and served as the editor-in-chief of Gizmodo.\nAward-winning broadcaster Ziya Tong anchored Daily Planet, Discovery Channel's flagship science program, until its final season in 2018. Tong also hosted the CBC's Emmy-nominated series ZeD, PBS's national prime-time series Wired Science, and worked as a correspondent for NOVA scienceNOW alongside Neil deGrasse Tyson on PBS. She served as the Vice Chair of WWF Canada until 2019, and was elected to the WWF International Board in 2020. She is the author of The Reality Bubble, a groundbreaking and wonder-filled look at the hidden things that shape our lives in unexpected and sometimes dangerous ways."

But genre conventions can shift, and they are often culture-specific. And there is a particular joy in a well-broken genre convention! Join us for readings and an awesome panel of queer SFF authors talking on this topic, organized by dave ring and Neon Hemlock Press.\nThe event is free, open to all, and captioned.\nREGISTER HERE: https://www.eventbrite.com/.../neon-hemlock-and-argo...\nCharlie Jane Anders is the author of Victories Greater Than Death, the first book in the young-adult Unstoppable trilogy, along with the short story collection Even Greater Mistakes. Her other books include The City in the Middle of the Night and All the Birds in the Sky. Her fiction and journalism have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Slate, McSweeney's, Mother Jones, the Boston Review, Tor.com, Tin House, Conjunctions, Wired Magazine, and other places. Her TED Talk, \"Go Ahead, Dream About the Future\" got 700,000 views in its first week. With Annalee Newitz, she co-hosts the podcast Our Opinions Are Correct.\nHA Clarke is here and queer, etc. They have been published in Lunch Ticket, PRISM international, Dream Pop Press, Portland Review, Gothic Nature Journal, Eidolon, and Chaleur Magazine. They were a 2019 Lambda Literary Fellow in Young Adult Fiction and a Pushcart nominee. They currently research queerness, labor, and monstrosity in grad school. The Scapegracers is their first novel.\nDanny Lore is a queer black writer/editor raised in Harlem and currently based in the Bronx. They write across the SFF spectrum, with short stories in Fireside, Fiyah, Nightlight and more, as well as comics from Marvel, DC, Vault and more. Their goal in their stories is to tie the element of SFF that they grew up with and love with the environments and people that reflect the world around them. When not writing, it's all video games, gunpla, doll collecting and makeup for them!\n\n\nNicasio Andres Reed is a writer, poet, and essayist whose work has appeared in venues such as Strange Horizons, Lightspeed, Uncanny Magazine, and Shimmer. He lives in Tagaytay, in the Philippines, with four dogs, some family, and the occasional uninvited monitor lizard. Find him at nicasioreed.com, or on Twitter @nicasiosilang.\nIzzy Wasserstein is a queer and trans woman who teaches writing and literature. She has published in in Clarkesworld, Apex, Beneath Ceaseless Skies and elsewhere. She shares a home with Nora E. Derrington and their animal companions. She\u2019s an enthusiastic member of the 2017 class of Clarion West."

Join authors Jason Baltazar and Nino Cipri as they explore the topic through readings and conversation on Friday, May 28th at 7 PM Eastern. The event is free, open to all, and captioned! RSVP required, sign up on Eventbrite here.\nJason Baltazar is a proud Salvadoran American, originally from the Appalachian corner of Maryland. He is currently completing a PhD at the University of Kansas focused on speculative fiction and postcolonial studies. He writes stories that leak across borders, conduct strange rituals, and speak with a weird heart on the tip of their tongue. His work has appeared in Boston Review, Bourbon Penn, F(r)iction magazine, and other venues. He is currently writing his first novel, a punk-infused dark fantasy about living in the hyphen. For more info please check out his website: jasonbaltazar.com\nNino Cipri is a queer and trans/nonbinary writer, editor, and educator. They are a graduate of the Clarion Writers' Workshop, and the University of Kansas's MFA program. A multidisciplinary artist, Nino has also written plays, screenplays, and radio features; performed as a dancer, actor, and puppeteer; and worked as a stagehand, bookseller, bike mechanic, and labor organizer.\nOne time, an angry person on the internet called Nino a verbal terrorist, which was pretty funny.\nNino's 2019 story collection Homesick won the Dzanc Short Fiction Collection Prize, was nominated for the Shirley Jackson and World Fantasy Award, and was chosen as one of the top ten books on the ALA's Over the Rainbow Reading List. Their novella Finna \u2014 about queer heartbreak, working retail, and wormholes \u2014 was published by Tor.com in 2020, and was nominated for the Lambda, Nebula, and Hugo awards. Its sequel Defekt came out in April 2021. Nino's YA horror debut, Burned and Buried, will be published by Holt Young Readers in 2022."

The event is free and captioned, and even if you've never come to a book club at the Argo before, you're more than welcome. (If you haven't gotten a chance to read the book, don't fret - you can still come along, but there might be spoilers!)\nCharlie Jane Anders is the author of Victories Greater Than Death , the first book in the young-adult Unstoppable trilogy, along with the short story collection Even Greater Mistakes . Her other books include The City in the Middle of the Night and All the Birds in the Sky . Her fiction and journalism have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Slate, McSweeney's, Mother Jones, the Boston Review, Tor.com, Tin House, Conjunctions, Wired Magazine , and other places. Her TED Talk, \"Go Ahead, Dream About the Future\" got 700,000 views in its first week. With Annalee Newitz, she co-hosts the podcast Our Opinions Are Correct.\nABOUT THE BOOK:\nOutsmart Your Enemies. Outrun the Galaxy.\n\u201cJust please, remember what I told you. Run. Don\u2019t stop running for anything.\u201d\nTina never worries about being 'ordinary'--she doesn't have to, since she's known practically forever that she's not just Tina Mains, average teenager and beloved daughter. She's also the keeper of an interplanetary rescue beacon, and one day soon, it's going to activate, and then her dreams of saving all the worlds and adventuring among the stars will finally be possible. Tina's legacy, after all, is intergalactic--she is the hidden clone of a famed alien hero, left on Earth disguised as a human to give the universe another chance to defeat a terrible evil.\nBut when the beacon activates, it turns out that Tina's destiny isn't quite what she expected. Things are far more dangerous than she ever assumed--and everyone in the galaxy is expecting her to actually be the brilliant tactician and legendary savior Captain Thaoh Argentian, but Tina....is just Tina. And the Royal Fleet is losing the war, badly--the starship that found her is on the run and they barely manage to escape Earth with the planet still intact.\nLuckily, Tina is surrounded by a crew she can trust, and her best friend Rachel, and she is still determined to save all the worlds. But first she'll have to save herself.\nBuckle up your seatbelt for this thrilling YA sci-fi adventure set against an intergalactic war from internationally bestselling author Charlie Jane Anders."

The Argo Bookshop, in conjunction with the JET Alumni Association of Quebec and Atlantic Canada, will be hosting its summer Japan Book Club on July 25.\nFor this meeting, we'll be discussing Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miri. This story focuses on the ghost of a homeless man, who was living in a tent community outside of Ueno Station in Tokyo. As his spirit wanders the grounds of the park, his mind casts back over the events of his life, in parallel with major Japanese events and the imperial family.\nThis stinging social critique and moving story won the National Book Award for Translation for 2020. As a bonus, we will be joined for our discussion by the translator of the book, Morgan Giles!\nJoin us online via Zoom for a lively discussion of a striking and thoughtful piece of Japanese literature! Email us at events @ argobookshop.ca for the link. You can read the book in any language. You're also welcome to come if you haven't read the book, but there will be spoilers."
